# opengl-engine

#### What Is This?

opengl-engine is nothing more than a public repo created to document my
progress with OpenGL throughout 2025. I do not intend for this to be a serious
project usable for more than hobbies, but I do intend for this to be a
minimally functional 3D engine that can be interacted with. I'm following the
*Learn OpenGL* tutorial series online. I have already worked with OpenGL,
but I stopped for a while, and so now I have to remember all of what I 
previously learnt.

If you happen to stumble upon this repo and want to learn some OpenGL, I highly
recommend the *Learn OpenGL* tutorial series.

If you don't know any of the math that's needed for this (linear algebra, mostly),
then I recommend you read the book *Linear Algebra Done Right*. That's pretty much
all I had to study for my BA in math, and it's more than you need for this.

Good luck!
